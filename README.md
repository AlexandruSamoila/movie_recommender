# Exploring Movie Recommendation Systems Using the Movies Dataset

## Objective:

Develop an AI model to meet the requirements of two distinct use cases for movie recommendation systems:

1. Finding movies with similar themes and genres (Content-Based Recommender)
2. Personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences (Collaborative Filtering)

## Introduction:

This project delves into the world of movie recommendation systems using the **Movies Dataset** from Kaggle. The dataset consists of valuable information about movies, such as titles, genres, release dates, and user ratings, which is used to build AI models capable of recommending movies based on themes, genres, and user preferences.

## Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is available [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/).

The dataset consists of two main files:

- **movies_metadata.csv**: Contains information about movies, including titles, genres, release dates, etc.
- **ratings.csv**: Contains user ratings for movies, including user IDs, movie IDs, and ratings.

## Use Cases:

### 1. Finding Movies with Similar Themes and Genres (Content-Based Recommender):

In this use case, the system identifies movies with similar themes and genres to a given movie. For example, if a user has rated **"Inception"** with five stars, the system will recommend other movies with similar themes and genres, such as **"Interstellar"** and **"The Matrix"**. The goal is to help users discover movies that align with their tastes, based on shared attributes like genres and themes.

### 2. Personalized Movie Recommendations Based on User Preferences (Collaborative Filtering):

This use case provides personalized movie recommendations by analyzing the preferences of users. The system identifies users with similar movie preferences and recommends movies based on what similar users have liked. The collaborative filtering approach is used to suggest movies that a user might enjoy, based on the collective ratings and preferences of similar users.

## System Architecture:

The system utilizes two recommendation models:

- **Content-Based Recommender**: Uses the genres and themes of movies to recommend similar ones based on user input.
- **Collaborative Filtering Recommender**: Leverages past user ratings and interactions to recommend personalized movies.

### Collaborative Filtering:

For collaborative filtering, the model is implemented using **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)**. The model is trained on user ratings and movie interactions, learning to predict ratings for unseen movies. The model architecture uses embeddings for users and movies, followed by multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) to predict ratings.

## Features:

- **Content-Based Recommendations**: Get recommendations for movies similar to a given movie based on shared genres and themes.
- **Collaborative Filtering Recommendations**: Get personalized movie recommendations based on a userâ€™s previous ratings and preferences.
- **Model Training**: Train the collaborative filtering model using the **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)** approach.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as nDCG, Precision@k, and Recall@k.

## Setup and Installation:

### Prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/)

### Installation Steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone [github.com/AlexandruSamoila/movie_recommender.git](https://github.com/AlexandruSamoila/movie_recommender.git)
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```
   python3 -m venv /path/to/new/venv
   source /path/to/new/venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\\Scripts\\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/) and place the `archive/` folder in the project folder

## Running the system

Before running the system, the dataset must be processed. To process the dataset, run the following command:

```
python3 src/dataset_process.py
```

This will generate a `data/` folder containing all the processed CSV files that the system will use.

### Collaborative Filtering Recommender

The collaborative filtering recommender requires training. To do this:

1. Modify the hyperparameters in `src/train.py` according to your preferences

2. Run the following command to train the model:

```
   python3 src/train.py
```

This will train the model using the training data and save the trained model to a checkpoint.

To evaluate the model, you need to:

1. Modify the k parameter and the model path in `src/evaluate.py` to match your desired evaluation settings.

2. Run the following command to evaluate the trained model:

```
   python3 src/evaluate.py
```

This will compute evaluation metrics nDCG@k, Precision@k, and Recall@k based on the test dataset.

Once everything is set up, you can run the system and interact with the movie recommendation models:

```
python3 src/main.py
```

### Content-Based Recommender:

To run the content-based recommender, select option 1 when prompted. This will load the content_movies.csv dataset and recommend movies with similar themes and genres based on a given movie.

### Collaborative Filtering Recommender:

To run the collaborative filtering recommender, select option 2 when prompted. The system will load the movie and ratings data, initialize the NCF model, and provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.
